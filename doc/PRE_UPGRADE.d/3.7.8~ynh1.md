Hello you (if there is at least one user of this app ^^).

The original cops repository was not maintained anymore and a contributor has taken the maintenance over in the following repo: https://github.com/mikespub-org/seblucas-cops.

It seems quite active so I’ve made it the default repo where the updates will come from (it was important to change because the old repo didn’t work with php > 8.x although older version are not supported anymore and it increases the risk on the server).

So, enjoy this new version!
